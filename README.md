### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am Tim Cartwright, a DBA / Developer from Houston Texas

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the repos I maintain as well as my 9 to 5.
  - I tend to post a lot of loose sql files and powershell scripts to my [GIST](https://gist.github.com/tcartwright)
- I have a variety of interests:
  -  SQL Server 
      -  Administration
      -  T-SQL and DB Optimization
  -  Application and Web development
  -  Devops
  -  Administrative scripts and tools   
-  I am willing to collaborate on anything that piques my interest. Or accept collaboration on any of my repos. :smile:
